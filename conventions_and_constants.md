# Conventions

I think we clarify some terminology, which has been slightly confusing in the past and will be necessary to clarify for writing in the future. This is what I'm proposing:

Word = An English word we use in the experiment, i.e., chalk, power, brown, etc.

Anagram = A particular shuffling of a word, i.e. HALCK, REWOP, etc.

Subject = Someone who takes the experiment. (I think it's better than participant.)

Phase = A unique trial/calibration/black screen by a certain subject.

Trial = A unique phase, which is also a trial (solving an anagram).

Part = Either 1st (calibration) part or easy, medium, or hard 2nd part of the planned experiments. 

Bigram = Two-letter combination

In-word-bigram = Bigram in the solution word

Letter Gaze Sequence (LGS) = Sequence of letters read by the subject in a trial
